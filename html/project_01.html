                <h1>Lik Natural - Energy Lemonade Branding</h1>
                <p>Lik Natural was originally marketed as a sports drink for professional cyclists. Like was having trouble making sales to such a tiny target group so they needed to rethink. In the briefing they told us to create a rebranding which targeted a new demographic, in the hope that it would exceed current sales.

                    Note: these designs were commissioned by Mediacollege Amsterdam in collaboration with Lik Natural.

                <p><span class="subhead">Rebranding a sportsdrink</span>
                    I believed strongly that the brand could gain popularity if branded the right way. The recipe of Lik consisted out of only organic ingredients, which resulted in long lasting energy. For the rebrand I wanted to target young adults between the ages of 18 - 25. At the time, there was a big craze around organically produced products within this target group, so it seemed like the right move. The craze combined with the beneficial increase in energy seemed like the product had the potential to become the next viral product.

                    The rebranded identity of Lik was inspired by another trend which was popular at the time of design. A vintage retro look and feel in a modern sleeve. The patterns, bottles, stickers and logo are directly inspired by the retro style. These combined with modern colours, typefaces and shapes make up for the visual style of Lik that I designed.

                <h1>Amsterdam Dance Event x Soundcloud - Branding/UX design</h1>
                <p>“A New interpretation of waiting”<br><br>

                    Amsterdam Dance Event is an enormous event that attracts thousands of visitors. With such an amount of visitors comes long queuing times. The mockups below display a digital service that make an attempt at making these waiting lines shorter and more user friendly.


                    <br><br>
                    Note: these designs were commissioned by Amsterdam University of Applied Science. Amsterdam Dance Event and Soundcloud were not involved in this project.

                <p><span class="subhead">A new queue</span>
                    The platform removes the need for the user to be physically present at the queue. He or she can now queue through the app by just connecting their e-ticket. Changing the waiting line to a more-bearable ‘waiting area’. Furthermore the app has a bonus added that I thought the target group would like.

                    Amsterdam Dance Event is a huge event for the EDM community. An organisation as ADE has somewhat of a responsibility to its demographic. As a result I’ve created a feature that allows users to nominate unknown artists, through their Soundcloud account, for the line-up of the upcoming year. During their wait at the waiting area, samples of these artists will be played. At the end of each users’ waiting time, the user can vote on who he or she believes has the talent to be granted a spot in the upcoming year of ADE.

                    The platform hopes to give visitors a more pleasant waiting experience with a new interpretation of how we should queue. The platform can also help ADE and Soundcloud gather data and insights about the EDM community.</p>

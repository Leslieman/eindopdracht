                <h1>Rowgress: UX Design</h1>
                <p>
                    Professional athletes have one of the most disciplined jobs an individual could have. They eat, train, sleep and repeat. The project aimed to assist athletes with their strict way of life. During the briefing I was given an athlete and a unique problem to that athlete I had to solve. I ended up creating a digital service which helped rowers track and share their training data. Named Rowgress.
                    <br><br>
                    Note: these designs were commissioned by Amsterdam University of Applied Science.

                    To create a service that aims to assist such a specific and unique target group, we had to start by doing lots of research. We had to understand every aspect of the professional athletes life, only then we could design a service that would truly solve his problem. Our assigned athlete was an olympic rower and we had to design a way where he can track and evaluate his training data. At the time, he was tracking his training data by pen and paper. We thought of replacing this method outdate method. Using training wearables we were able to track a majority of the training data the athlete needed for daily evaluations. The collected data was directly translated into infographics on the app. Now, the athlete can compare and evaluate training data more accurately and conveniently. Furthermore we added a feature which allowed the athlete to share relevant training data with teammates and coaches.
